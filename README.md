# knitapps - Applications for Knitting

There are different ideas about the development of knitting utilities in your proposals, but the main goal are clear: We need to make it easy for people to knit and to use computers (PC, mobile phones) to create their knits. What do we have already?

## Knitting Machine Hacks

We have projects with overlapping ideas, code, goals. And we have knitting machine hacks in different ways and with different hardware:

a) Hacks using original hardware from our friend Steve Conklin (https://github.com/sconklin/knitting_machine / https://github.com/sconklin/Brother-Knitting-Machine-Interfaces)

b) Brother hacks using Arduino Duo (https://github.com/mcanet/knitic)

c) Brother hacks using Arduino Uno (http://ayab-knitting.com)

d) Pfaff hacks https://www.hackerspace-bamberg.de/Passap_pfaff_e6000 (Arduino Uno)

e) Closed source hacks apparently “hacking” or re-implementing/re-making the proprietary format of knitting machines http://knyttan.com 

### New Knitting Machine Constructions

We also have projects working on creating new Open Source knitting machines

a) Plastic printable round knitting https://github.com/fashiontec/circle-knitting

b) Plastic printable round knitting with metal needles using Knitic (http://www.knitic.com/2015/02/13/circular-knitic-wemake/)

c) Straight knitting machine with standard parts (https://github.com/g3rard/OpenKnit) 


### FIRST STEPS AND STUDENT PROJECTS

Please get yourself acquainted with those projects. Use online translation if no English version is available.

The question is now, what are the next steps to enable simple and easy knitting? We need:

1. An Open Source circular knitting machine, that is not just a prototype

2. A library that supports different hacks and can be used by different projects (through an abstraction layer)

3. Improved interfaces and interfaces that can be used through a browser

4. Support for more features and a good list of features and how they could be implemented
